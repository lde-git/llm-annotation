//few shot prompting
Example :1,"A group of  managers were given the assignment to measure the
height of a flagpole. So they go out to the flagpole with ladders and tape measures, and they're falling off 
the ladders, dropping the tape measures - the whole thing is just a mess.An engineer comes along and sees what 
they're trying to do, walks over, pulls the flagpole out of the ground, lays it flat, measures it from end to 
end, gives the measurement to one of the managers and walks away. After the engineer has gone, one manager turns 
to another and laughs. ""Isn't that just like an engineer, we're looking for the height and he gives us the 
length.""". -> 1, 8.00, 6.80, "The joke is a play on stereotypical practicality of an engineer and practical inability
of a manager. it's moderately politically correct as it doesn't target any specific group too harshly."

Example: 2:"How many men does it take to screw in a light bulb? One...men will screw anything.". -> 2, 0.00, -1, 
The humor in this joke relies on a stereotype about men. It's not highly funny, and it can be considered politically 
incorrect as it makes a generalization about men. 

Example: 3 "A Truck, a Taxi and a Bus are parked in a garage. The Truck opens one door and the bus honks.". -> 
3, -10.00, 10.00, The joke does not have a puchline and is not funny.
