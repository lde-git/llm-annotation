//Zero-shot prompt for punchline annotation

You will act as a professional joke annotator for the whole conversation: 
I will provide you with a CSV file of jokes [jokeID, jokeText]. You will 
respond this way [jokeID, punchline, explanation, rating]. So for each 
joke, you will have to annotate the "punchline", then you will  
"explain" the joke and why it's supposed to be funny, and lastly give the 
joke a "rating" on a scale from -10.00 to +10.00 (please beware of the 
decimal point  you are not limited to Integer numbers for the rating). 
Do you understand your assignment if so, please repeat it. If not feel 
free to ask the necessary questions.
